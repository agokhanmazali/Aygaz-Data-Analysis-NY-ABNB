Airbnb NYC 2019 Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset. The dataset contains information about Airbnb listings in New York City, including details about the listing's location, room type, price, minimum night stay requirements, number of reviews, and availability throughout the year.

Key Insights

Price Distribution: The distribution of listing prices is heavily skewed to the right, indicating that most listings are in the lower price range. The "typical" price range for an Airbnb listing in this dataset is around $100-$200.

Room Type: "Entire home/apt" is the most common type of listing, followed by "Private room". "Shared room" is the least common type. The room type has a significant impact on the price, with entire homes/apartments being the most expensive on average.

Neighbourhood Groups: The data covers five neighbourhood groups: Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. Manhattan has the highest average price among all the neighbourhood groups. Most listings are concentrated in Manhattan, Brooklyn, and parts of Queens.

Number of Listings per Host: Most hosts have only one listing, but a significant proportion (about one-third) have multiple listings.


Visualizations

The analysis includes a variety of visualizations to better understand the data, including bar plots, scatter plots, histograms, and a correlation heatmap. Each plot provides different insights into the data.

The Airbnb NYC 2019 dataset provides valuable insights into the short-term rental market in New York City. This exploratory data analysis helps uncover the key factors that influence the price and availability of listings, such as room type and neighbourhood group. The findings can be useful for potential hosts to better understand the market and for guests to make informed decisions about their stay.

Further analysis could involve a deeper dive into the text data (such as listing descriptions), more granular location data, or predictive modeling to predict listing prices based on the available features.
